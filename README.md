# React Air Quality Lookup

Visit the website at: https://quinnbooth.github.io/React-Air-Quality-Lookup/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Data is sourced from the OpenWeather Air Pollution API along with geospatial information from simplemaps' World Cities Database.

An API proxy is hosted on the Deno Javascript Runtime to keep keys secure.
